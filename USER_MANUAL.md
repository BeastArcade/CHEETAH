More advanced configuration settings are available via the Web Configurator. To access it, while unplugged, hold the "Start" button, connect CHEETAH to a PC, release the button, then browse to [http://192.168.7.1](http://192.168.7.1).

CHEETAH is fully compatible with PC, PS3, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, MiSTer, and Android.  It is also partially compatible with PS4 (limited by an 8-minute timeout).  An adapter such as the [Brook Wingman FGC](https://www.brookaccessory.com/products/wingmanfgc/index.html) enables full PS4 compatibility and partial PS5 compatiblity (fighting games only).

To update CHEETAH's firmware, first download the Flatbox rev4 version of the desired firmware from the [GP2040-CE Download Page](https://gp2040-ce.info/downloads/download-page/).  Then, while unplugged, hold "Start" + "Select" + "Up", connect CHEETAH to a PC, release the buttons, and copy the .uf2 file obtained from the GP2040-CE Download Page into CHEETAH's directory (the RPI-RP2 folder).  After the files are copied over, it will reboot into the new firmware.  Access the Web Configurator to confirm that the firmware was installed successfully.<br>
**NOTE: Recommend [nuking](https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/GP2040-CE/blob/main/site/docs/downloads/flash_nuke.uf2) the current firmware before installing the updated firmware.**
